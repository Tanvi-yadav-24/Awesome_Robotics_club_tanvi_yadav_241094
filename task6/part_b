1. if one side of the crawler (left or right) stops due to a motor fault or gear jam, then there might occur some rotation kind movement 
   of the bot.
2. now the  bot will become unbalanced due to uneven forces on both side now.and now the tipping risk has increased. the bot may tilt and may 
   fall.
3. since now one motor will stop working. so we can detect the difference between their angular velocities. second we can detect change in 
   acceleration using the IMU sensor.. also the camera sensor can detect the tilt in the view.
