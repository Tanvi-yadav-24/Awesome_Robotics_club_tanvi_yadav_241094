1. since i have to take a flat platform i would use square or rectangle. here i am considering square.
   Then for proper balancing of the ball i would prefer to use 4 servo motors as with these 4 servo motors,
   the platform would be able to move in 4 independent directions means it would have 4 DOF. like i can tilt forward, backward, left ,right which will increases the
   ability of the bot to balance the ball. then i would either prefer to put the servos at each corner or maybe we can also put them at the centres of each side.
2. additional degree of freedom will improve the stability and control precision because since we have more motors and each of the 4 motors will control movement in 4 different 
   independent directions so this will help in balancing. another thing is that if the ball is moving fast then also it is helpful as the movement will be controlled by 4 motors.
3. first i will place a square platform. then i will take 4 motors and place each of  them at each corner using joints and making proper connections .
   the ball will be on the centre of the square platform and a camera is above to track the ball.
4. pros of the system are that:- a) it helps to improve stability, responsiveness and control precision 
                                 b) it will give faster response
                                 c) it will balance the ball more effectively
   cons of the system are :- a) since we have 4 motors, therefore number of connections will increase and will become complex.
                             b) also the cost will increase as we increase the number of motors.
                             c) for the functioning of motors, we have to write more code like we write code for motors and the sensors in ardueino IDE. so the code complexity increases.
