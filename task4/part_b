1. if we are not using cameras, then we can use sensors to detect and track the performance of the ball. 
   we can use the force sensor as due to the weight of the ball , it will exert force so the force sensor will detect the normal reaction(force)
2. we know that force sensor detects the force if applied by any object. so we can place sensors at each of the corner. 
   then when the ball will be near or on that corner , it will detect the amount of force..likewise all the four sensors will detect the force 
   so out of all four sensors, one will record the largest amount of force. it means that ball is at position .. so like this we can detect and 
   track the position of the ball.
3. pros:- these sensors are't much costly.
          and direct contact with the ball is not needed.
   cons:- accuracy is not present in determining the position of the ball .like when the ball is moving very fast.


   OR
   another idea which i can think of is using IR sensor. like we know IR sensor can work in the way that if we put a obstacle in its front then
   it gets a signal so we can code in the ardueino like when it detects the obstacle it means ball is present there so we write a code for the
   motor accordingly. but i think this will not work perfectly as it will detect the ball only when it is exactly at its top. and 
   here contact will be needed.. like we can't place any object in between the sensor and ball. also if we are using this then , we have to use 
   so many IR sensors.
