i have choosen ball balancing bot and stepXplorer project because both seemed intersting to me. in ball balancing, i feel the interesting part was balancing .
like i wanted to know how the bot will balance the ball and change its position accordingly using sensors and servo motors. i know little bit about the servo motors.
i have done task using ir sensor and servo motor. but  i could not figure out completely that how it helps in balancing so i wanted to learn this.
second in stepXplorer i liked how the robot was moving by itself using the ultrasonic sensors and how it was balancing itself..so i wanted to learn all these things and build this bot myself.
